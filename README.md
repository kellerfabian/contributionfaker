# Fake GitHub Contribution Generator

This open-source project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and allows users to generate fake GitHub contribution charts. You can customize the chart's contribution frequency and appearance. It's a fun tool to visualize and experiment with GitHub contribution graphs without affecting real accounts.
